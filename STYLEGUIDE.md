## goals

the goals of the newsletter are:

1. to foster collaboration between people on the town
1. to serve the town's vision of being radically inclusive
 by boosting users who are newer / less visible
1. to highlight the incredible quality of contributions to
 tilde.town in whatever form, whether that is creating art
 on a ~ page, writing software for the server or projects
 that do not involve the terminal.

if you are contributing please try to keep these in mind!

## formatting

### width

the maximum length of a line should be 75 characters so that it
 comfortably fits in the alpine window.

### separators

use 75 dashes as a content separator:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### headings

subheadings are created using figlet with the font smslant. you can invoke
 it all like:

```bash
figlet -f smslant tilde.town times
```

#### sub-headings

I have just made them ALL CAPS!!!! but it is up to you how to format them idk

## referencing other users

include a link to their ~ page the first time you mention them. always 
 use gender-neutral terms or try to use their names in place of a
 gendered term ("jumblesale's page" rather than "his page").

## spelling, grammar

nobody cares just try to be honest and true to yourself. typos are welcome
 because they are a beautiful reminder of our fallibility.
